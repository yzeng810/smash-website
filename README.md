## Typography

I choose Abril Fatface and Open Sans because the following reasons 

1. They pair well 

2. Abril Fatface as a header creates strong contrast which is better at attracting Reader's attentions than the previous one 

3. Abril Fatface was originally inspired by the heavy lifiting fonts used in advertising posters, and this really fits to presidential candidates' favors: advertisement of themselves to gain more votes 

4. Open Sans looks very friendly, and that's the message these politican want to bring to their voter in order to let the voters feel these politican can speak for them, and these voters are the target readers of this website as well. 

## Readability

1. Removal of the AOS element 
   - Because it really messes up the contents and creates readability problems

2. Change of the h2 and h3 style
   - To bring more contrasts to show emphasis

3. Change the distance between each politican session and each paragraph within 
   - To improve proximidity so that items that has relationship will appear to be closer together
4. Change of the font style 
   - Instead of randomly using fontstyle to different elements in the previous one, except the header is Impact all other headings are Abril Fatface. All passage elements or the one that has no need for emphasis are all Open Sans.
